# Seed of Andromeda
This repository contains the source code for Seed of Andromeda.

## Getting Started
This guide will walk you through setting up as a contributor to the
Seed of Andromeda project. There is a basic requirement of having several
packages installed prior to being able to develop. We support all three
major operating systems: Windows, Mac and Linux.

### Contributing
Before beginning your SoA journey, please take a moment to use the following resources
to get an idea of how to contribute, what you might be able to contribute to specifically,
and to meet some of the other contributors.
* [Wiki](https://github.com/RegrowthStudios/SoACode-Public/wiki)
* [Issues](https://github.com/RegrowthStudios/SoACode-Public/issues)

### Setting Up:
**IMPORTANT**: Before following any of the instructions linked below for the platforms we support,
please do take a second to fork the repository! If you are new to GitHub, you can 
do so by clicking the "fork" button on the top right of this page.

If you have cloned the repository before forking, no worries! We can fix it, by following [these instructions](#fixing-a-pre-fork-clone).

Now we're forked, follow the link to the section on setting up for your OS of choice:
* [Windows](#windows)
* [Mac](#mac)

    build/SoA/launch-soa-{Release|Debug}.cmd    # or launch from within your Visual Studio environment
    ```
    * Linux:
    ```bash
    ./build/SoA/launch-soa.sh
    ```
4. Set origin of submodules to your forked repositories
```cmd
# Assuming we're already inside the top-level directory of your SoACode-Public repository.
cd Vorb
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_NAME/Vorb.git
cd game
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_NAME/SoAGameData.git
```
If you haven't forked, either Vorb or SoAGameData as you don't intend to contribute to that repository, then you don't need to run the commands corresponding to that repository.


# Fixing a Pre-Fork Clone

So, you've accidentally cloned the repository before forking it, eh? No problem. Just run the following git commands inside of the repository and everything will be as it should be!

Firstly, if you still haven't, fork the repositories you want to contribute to!

Now you have a fork we want to set `origin` of each of your local repositories (which is the default remote repository to push changes to) to your corresponding forked repositories:
```bash
# Assuming we're already inside the top-level directory of your SoACode-Public repository.
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_NAME/SoACode-Public.git
cd Vorb
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_NAME/Vorb.git
cd game
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_NAME/SoAGameData.git
```
If you haven't forked, either Vorb or SoAGameData as you don't intend to contribute to that repository, then you don't need to do run the commands corresponding to that repository.

That's it! It's all fixed. :)
